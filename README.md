<b>Description</b>

<p align="justify">
This repository contains the analysis and methodology for working with datasets related to different types of obesity. In this example, I implemented several pipelines to clean the data, addressed the issue of balanced and unbalanced classes to prevent overfitting, and trained multiple models to compare their performance and select the most suitable one.

<b>About the dataset</b>
<p align="justify">
The dataset is part of a kaggle competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
